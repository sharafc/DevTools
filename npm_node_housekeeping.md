# NPM and Node Modules Housekeeping

To keep your local environment clean, it could be sometimes a good idea to just run:

  npm clean-install
 
and get rid of all those piled up and unused packages you collected.


If you are using a shrinkwrap.json you could also just run
 
 npm ci

and install the dependencies from there.
